'''First, we need to install the required package using the following command in our python environment''' '''ok bro'''
pip install pyspellchecker 
Now we see below how the package is used to point out the wrongly spelled words as well as make some suggestions about possible correct words.

from spellchecker import SpellChecker

spell = SpellChecker()

# find those words that may be misspelled
misspelled = spell.unknown(['let', 'us', 'wlak','on','the','groun'])

for word in misspelled:
    # Get the one `most likely` answer
    print(spell.correction(word))

    # Get a list of `likely` options
    print(spell.candidates(word))
'''When we run the above program we get the following output âˆ’

group
{'group', 'ground', 'groan', 'grout', 'grown', 'groin'}
walk
{'flak', 'weak', 'walk'}
Case Sensitive
If we use Let in place of let then this becomes a case sensitive comparison of the word with the closest matched words in dictionary and the result looks different now.

from spellchecker import SpellChecker'''

spell = SpellChecker()

# find those words that may be misspelled
misspelled = spell.unknown(['Let', 'us', 'wlak','on','the','groun'])

for word in misspelled:
    # Get the one `most likely` answer
    print(spell.correction(word))

    # Get a list of `likely` options
    print(spell.candidates(word))
