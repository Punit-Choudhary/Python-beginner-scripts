# Hello-to-CHATBOT
A chatbot is a computer software able to interact with humans using a natural language. They usually rely on machine learning, especially on NLP.

# ⚙️🛠️Preparing Dependencies:
You’re only going to install the library ChatterBot for now. I recommend creating and using a new Python virtual environment for this purpose. Execute the following commands in your Python terminal:

run these command:
```sh
pip install chatterbot
```
```sh
pip install chatterbot_corpus
```

You can also try upgrading them:
```sh
pip install --upgrade chatterbot_corpus
```
```sh
pip install --upgrade chatterbot
```
That’s it. We’re ready to go.

# Communicating with a Bot🤖

You can communicate with your bot using its method .get_response(). Here’s an example of how that might look like :
