# ***Quiz Maker GUI***

This is basically a Quiz Application developed using python's built-in Tkinter module. It can be used to Create Questions that the user want to have in the quiz to be conducted. 
It is divided into Two scripts. Script ```createQuiz.py``` is for creating Questions for quiz whereas ```quiz.py``` is actually the quiz itself. ```***Questions.json***``` is where the Questions will be saved and these 'Questions' will be used in the Actual Quiz (```quiz.py```). 

## Features

Insteading of hardcoding the quiz questions, I created ```createQuiz.py``` with GUI to add the questions without any hassle so anyone can use it.
The Quiz app and questions will directly communicate with each other thanks to python's another built in ```json``` module.
Graphical Interface is created using Tkinter module in python to make it simple for non-technical users.
Simple to use and easily Customizable, no extra configurations are needed except for having ```python(preferably a newer version)```on your machine.
This can be used to make your own quizzes too.
